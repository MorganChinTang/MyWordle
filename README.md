# My Wordle
A simple Wordle-like mobile game built with Kotlin in Android Studio. The goal is to showcase my basic understanding of Android game development—layouts, state management, and simple UI interactions—wrapped in a fun, lightweight project you can run on any emulator or physical device.

## What is Wordle
Wordle is a game where you try to guess a 5 letter word in 6 tries. I reference from New York Times Wordle game. The game has a preset word database to guess from.
